# Infinite Chess Web Server #

[InfiniteChess.org](https://www.infinitechess.org) is a free and ad-less website for playing several variants on an infinite, boundless board.

What began as an indie project by [Naviary](https://www.youtube.com/@Naviary) in 2022 has been growing since. What drives this project is the concept of Chess and Infinity intertwined! There shall be no more limits, only freedom! That being said, there are many interesting tactics that arise from the size of the board, not to mention lots of wild mathematics surrounding it, just check out a couple of the [YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@Naviary)!

## Contributing

This project is open source! If you skills in html, css, javascript, typescript, or Node, we welcome contributions! To get started collaborating, please read the [Setup Guide](./docs/SETUP.md)!

There are still MANY more items I have planned for this project. Just a few of them are:

- Board Editor
- Engine play
- Games with infinitely many pieces
- 4 Player
- Massive Multiplayer Online

Because I want Infinite Chess to grow to as big of an audience as possible, it's licensed with a goal of keeping this game free forever! Check out [Copying](./docs/COPYING.md) for more details.
