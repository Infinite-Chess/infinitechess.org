# Infinite Chess Web Server #

[InfiniteChess.org](https://www.infinitechess.org) is a free and ad-less website for playing all kinds of chess variants on an infinite, boundless board.

What began as an indie project by [Naviary](https://www.youtube.com/@Naviary) in 2022 has been growing ever since. Inspired by the concepts of chess and infinity, he set out to craft a space where anyone can experience the thrills of freedom and exploration, reimagined within the familiar world of chess. No more limits, tear down the edges of the board - here we come!
