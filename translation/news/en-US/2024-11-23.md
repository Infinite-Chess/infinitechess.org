## Themes Update - v1.5 - Released! 

- Adjust the color of the board from a wide variety of options inside the new settings dropdown menu!
- Choose whether legal moves are represented by dots or squares!
- On desktop, adjust your perspective mode mouse sensitivity and field of view!
- The settings dropdown also includes a ping meter, so you can tell how fast your connection is!
- The language selection has been moved from the footer to the settings dropdown.
- Preferences are saved both on the browser, and on the server, so it will remember them wherever you go!
- Completely redesigned the header bar! Added the Infinite Chess logo, vector graphics for each link, the settings gear dropdown. Also, there's no more horizontal scrolling needed on mobile, because the links adapt to the available space!
- The board now retains momentum when you throw it with the mouse or your finger!
- Login sessions are now automatically renewed when you reconnect 1 day after the previous renewal! No more abruptly being logged out when you are in the middle of a game.
- Clocks now match exactly what the server says, subtract half your ping, instead of going off of your system clock, which may or may be out of sync with the server machine's system clock. This was the cause of a bug displaying incorrect clock values.
- Migrated members' account storage to a SQLite Database system.
- Each member has been given a unique identifier. This cannot be changed, and cannot be reused when the account is deleted. Now, even when players change their name, their id will forever point to the same account. Game notation now includes the id of each player.
