Update 1.3 released today! This includes MANY new speed and user experience improvements. Just a few are:

- The transition to websockets, decreasing the delay when your opponent moves.
- No longer getting disconnected when you switch tabs.
- Audible cues when you or someone else creates an invite, or makes a move.
- Added the 50-move rule.
- A drum countdown effect is now played at 10 seconds left on the clock.
- An auto-resignation timer will start if you're opponent goes AFK (with an audible warning).
