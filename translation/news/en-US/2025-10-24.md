## Test News - Unread Notification Feature

This is a test news post created on October 24, 2025 to verify the unread news notification system is working correctly.

### What to Check:

- **Header Badge**: If you're logged in, you should see a red circular badge near the "News" link with the number "1"
- **NEW Badge**: When you visit the news page, this post should have a red "NEW" badge next to the date
- **Auto Mark as Read**: After staying on the news page for 1 second, the header badge should disappear and the "NEW" badge will remain (but future visits won't show it as new)

If you see all of the above, the feature is working perfectly! ðŸŽ‰
