 * Constructs a gamefile from provided arguments. Use the *new* keyword.
 * @param {Object} metadata - An object containing the property `Variant`, and optionally `UTCDate` and `UTCTime`, which can be used to extract the version of the variant. Without the date, the latest version will be used.
 * @param {Object} [options] - Options for constructing the gamefile.
 * @param {string[]} [options.moves=[]] - Existing moves, if any, to forward to the front of the game. Should be specified if reconnecting to an online game or pasting a game. Each move should be in the most compact notation, e.g., `['1,2>3,4','10,7>10,8Q']`.
 * @param {Object} [options.variantOptions] - If a custom position is needed, for instance, when pasting a game, then these options should be included.
 * @param {Object} [options.gameConclusion] - The conclusion of the game, if loading an online game that has already ended.
