                <p class="center" style="margin-bottom:3em">By using this site, you agree to abide by the following terms. If you do not agree, you must immediately stop using the site.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>If you are under 18, you must receive consent from a parent or legal guardian to use this site and to create an account.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Parents:</h2>
                <p>There is an algorithm in place for prohibiting users setting their name to common cuss words. At this time there is no method of communication between members on the site.</p>
                <p>Currently, members cannot set their own profile picture. There is a plan to allow this feature. At that time we will do our best to prevent innapropriate profile pictures.</p>

                <h2>Fair Play</h2>
                <p>You cannot create more than 1 account. If you would like to change the email address associated with your account, <a href="mailto:infinitechess.org@gmail.com">contact us.</a></p>
                <p>To keep play fun and fair for everyone, you must NOT:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Modify or manipulate the code in any way, including but not limited to: Using console commands, local overrides, custom scripts, modifying http requests, etc. This can be done to intentionally break the game, or to give you an advantage.</p></li>
                    <li><p>In rated games, receive help/advice from another person or program as to what you should play. (Creating an engine is ok and encouraged, but you must limit its use to unrated games)</p></li>
                    <li><p>Trade elo points with other people by purposefully losing with intent to boost the elo of your opponent, or by receiving elo points from an opponent that intends to lose to boost your own rating. This abuses the system and creates unaccurate ratings according to your level of skill.</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>In all your language on the site, you must remain clean, no vulgarity or cursing. You cannot bully, harass, or threaten anyone, or do anything that is illegal. You cannot spam other users or forums.</p>
